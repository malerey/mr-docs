# Documentation Showcase App

This is a POC for a Next.js application designed to showcase a documentation section for a Next.js app. Developers can easily integrate and render their documentation files by dropping them into the respective folders.

Working example here: https://mr-docs.vercel.app/docs/01-README 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/docs` with your browser to see the result.

## Adding Documentation

To add documentation, simply drop your markdown or content files into the designated folders within the `/docs` directory. The application will automatically render these files and update the documentation section.

## Styling

In progress!!
